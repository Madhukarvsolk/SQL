# LKQ Accessories for the Most Sold Car in November 2022

Note - 

* This is My Personal Project where I require lot of information which I am not accessed to. Yet, I am doing with required common knowledge.

# Background

I came across the idea that LKQ company offers quality recycled spar parts of every kind of vehicle on the market including the model variants.

Just a small idea triggred me to check whether LKQ meets demand of supplying the recycled vehicle parts of the perticular specific vehicle in time.

If it has to meet the demand, there should be the vehicles parts already of those models recycled.

So, I thought to check for a most selling vehicle in perticular month, how much vehicles must LKQ recycle and make it available to the market after warrenty of 2 years.

# Problem Statement

Create the SQL queries and dashboard for the availability of accessories due to increase in the demand of highly sold vehicles and requirement of that particular recycled vehicle parts for supply after warrented time.

# My Approch 

* Step 1 - Firstly I will pull the data from most sold vehicle in 2022 NOV in INDIA and check for its Warrenty date.

* Step 2 - Pull the data of LKQ accessories of regularly selling car parts using WEBSCRAPPING.

* Step 3 - Data Cleaning and Modification.

* Step 4 - Create Database in SQL. Combine the details of Step 1 and Step 2. Doing SQL Queries.

* Step 5 - Create a Power BI Dashboard
